h1. swimdb

Just messing around with rails 3, mongomapper, devise and BDD(rspec, cucumber)

h2. Newest changes

* devise almost fully implemented, but i'm not sure if i got all test scenarios
unfortanatly the before_filer killed my controller hack to get validation errors on items
dont know how to fix this now have to think about it. Either I have to hack even more in
the controller or I could just switch to the embedded items; there I can use the default
controller.

h2. Features until now

* creating and editing a schedule with nested items in one form
* calculate the complete distance of the schedule
* authentication

h2. Known Issues

* when entering an invalid item on the schedule's form you don't receive an error,
it just saves the schedule without the invalid item -fixed, but not great- its back

h2. TODO

* add device to the hole site *working on it*
* add a commenting system
* add tags to the schedule

h2. meh

Testing with rspec and cucumber under ruby-1.9.2 and ree-1.8.7,
think i will switch to ree only in the future because thats on my server
