h1. swimdb

Just messing around with rails 3, mongomapper, devise and BDD(rspec, cucumber)

h2. Newest changes

* devise almost fully implemented, but i'm not sure if i got all test scenarios
unfortanatly the before_filer killed my controller hack to get validation errors on items
dont know how to fix this now have to think about it. Either I have to hack even more in
the controller or I could just switch to the embedded items; there I can use the default
controller.
* added tags(embeded) + tag cloud(mapreduce)
* changed Items to an embedded document, not sure about that change. Had to move all
the parsing logic into schedule because i cannot use the before_save callback.
On the good side it completely made my controller changes obsolete, now it
is back to standart inherited_resources

h2. Features until now

* creating and editing a schedule with nested items in one form
* calculate the complete distance of the schedule
* tag a schedule


h2. Known Issues
* looks awfull because I dont have an stylesheet
* the standard controller does not set the rank of the items;
nonIssue because of the array??
* not really an issue but I not really know how that mapreduce snippet works ;)

h2. TODO
* add a commenting system
* search for schedules with tags(scope :where(tag in tags)???)
* search in general
* add a original date the the schedule to indicate the original creation of the schedule

h2. meh

Testing with rspec and cucumber under ruby-1.9.2 and ree-1.8.7,
think i will switch to ree only in the future because thats on my server
