h1. swimdb

Just messing around with rails 3, mongomapper, devise and BDD(rspec, cucumber)

h2. Newest changes

* moved to ree; runs way faster than 1.9.2 on 'rake spec'
before it took 26 seconds to completly run 'time rake spec'(16 with spork)
now it runs in 15 seconds (11 with spork)
* commenting

h2. Features until now

* creating and editing a schedule with nested items in one form
* calculate the complete distance of the schedule
* tag a schedule
* authentication(devise)
* comments

h2. Known Issues

* looks awfull because I dont have an stylesheet
* not really an issue but I not really know how that mapreduce snippet works ;)
* no comment creation with ajax
* I cant show validation errors for the comments


h3. to think about

* changed Items to an embedded document, not sure about that change. Had to move all
the parsing logic into schedule because i cannot use the before_save callback.
On the good side it completely made my controller changes obsolete, now it
is back to standart inherited_resources


h2. TODO

* search for schedules with tags(scope :where(tag in tags)???)
* search in general

h2. meh

Testing with rspec and cucumber under ree-1.8.7
