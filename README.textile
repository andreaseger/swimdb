h1. swimdb

Just messing around with rails 3, mongomapper, devise and BDD(rspec, cucumber)

h2. Newest changes

* added devise to the mix; using devise_mongo_mapper gem to support MM
till now I only added the usernav(+spec), the rest is unprotected.

h2. Features until now

* creating and editing a schedule with nested items in one form
* calculate the complete distance of the schedule

h2. Known Issues

* -when entering an invalid item on the schedule's form you don't receive an error,-
-it just saves the schedule without the invalid item- fixed, but not great

h2. TODO

* add device to the hole site *working on it*
* add a commenting system
* add tags to the schedule
* add a original date the the schedule to indicate the original creation of the schedule

h2. meh

Testing with rspec and cucumber under ruby-1.9.2 and ree-1.8.7,
think i will switch to ree only in the future because thats on my server
