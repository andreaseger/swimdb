h1. swimdb

Just messing around with rails 3, mongomapper, devise and BDD(rspec, cucumber)

h2. Newest changes

* moved to ree; runs way faster than 1.9.2 on 'rake spec'
before it took 26 seconds to completly run 'time rake spec'(16 with spork)
now it runs in 15 seconds (11 with spork)
* some commenting to start with but unfinished

h2. Features until now

* creating and editing a schedule with nested items in one form
* calculate the complete distance of the schedule
* tag a schedule
* authentication(devise)

h2. Known Issues
* looks awfull because I dont have an stylesheet
* the standard controller does not set the rank of the items;
nonIssue because of the array??
* not really an issue but I not really know how that mapreduce snippet works ;)

h3. to think about

* changed Items to an embedded document, not sure about that change. Had to move all
the parsing logic into schedule because i cannot use the before_save callback.
On the good side it completely made my controller changes obsolete, now it
is back to standart inherited_resources


h2. TODO
* add a commenting system (working)
* search for schedules with tags(scope :where(tag in tags)???)
* search in general

h2. meh

Testing with rspec and cucumber under ruby-1.9.2 and ree-1.8.7,
think i will switch to ree only in the future because thats on my server
