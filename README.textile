===== swimDB =====
Just messing around with rails and mongomapper
try to spec most of the app and build it with BDD
==================

*Features until now*
* creating and editing a schedule with nested items in one form
* calculate the complete distance of the schedule

*Known Issues*
* when entering an invalid item on the schedule's form you don't receive an error, it just saves the schedule without the invalid item
* when you have an validation error on a schedule's field you loose all changes to the items

*TODO*
* fix the issues...(think they originate from mongomapper and the lack of accept_nested_attributes_from; perhaps i will try one of the implementations from gist)
* add device to the hole site
* add a commenting system
* add tags to the schedule
* add a original date the the schedule to indicate the original creation of the schedule

==================
Testing with rspec and cucumber for both ruby-1.9.2 and ree-1.8.7
