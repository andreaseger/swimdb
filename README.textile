h1. swimdb

Just messing around with rails 3, mongomapper, devise and BDD(rspec, cucumber)

h2. Newest changes

* search by tags(by clicking on them in the tag cloud)


h2. Features until now

* creating and editing a schedule with nested items in one form
* calculate the complete distance of the schedule
* tag a schedule
* authentication(devise)
* search/filter by tag

h2. Known Issues

* looks awfull because I dont have an stylesheet
* the standard controller does not set the rank of the items;
nonIssue because of the array??
* not really an issue but I not really know how that mapreduce snippet works ;)

h3. to think about

* changed Items to an embedded document, not sure about that change. Had to move all
the parsing logic into schedule because i cannot use the before_save callback.
On the good side it completely made my controller changes obsolete, now it
is back to standart inherited_resources


h2. TODO

* add a commenting system (working)
* search in general
* admin area

h2. meh

Testing with rspec and cucumber under ree
