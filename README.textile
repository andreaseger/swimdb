h1. swimdb

Just messing around with rails 3, mongomapper, devise and BDD(rspec, cucumber)

h2. Newest changes

* Admin Area
* fixed the issues with capybara 0.40rc, many breackage
* search by tags(by clicking on them in the tag cloud)
* commenting

h2. Features until now

* creating and editing a schedule with nested items in one form
* calculate the complete distance of the schedule
* authentication(devise)
* tag a schedule
* search/filter by tag
* comments

h2. Known Issues

* looks awfull because I dont have an stylesheet
* not really an issue but I not really know how that mapreduce snippet works ;)
* no comment creation with js


h3. to think about

* changed Items to an embedded document, not sure about that change. Had to move all
the parsing logic into schedule because i cannot use the before_save callback.
On the good side it completely made my controller changes obsolete, now it
is back to standart inherited_resources


h2. TODO

* search in general
* facebook login(branch omniauth)
* more JS and perhaps move to jquery(branch jquery)

h2. meh

Testing with rspec and cucumber under ree-1.8.7
