Just messing around with rails 3, mongomapper and BDD

*Newest changes*
* added tags(embeded) + tag cloud(mapreduce)
* changed Items to an embedded document, not sure about that change. Had to move all
the parsing logic into schedule because i cannot use the before_save callback.
On the good side it completely made my controller changes obsolete, now it
is back to standart inherited_resources

*Features until now*
* creating and editing a schedule with nested items in one form
* calculate the complete distance of the schedule
* tag a schedule


*Known Issues*
* looks awfull because I dont have an stylesheet
* the standard controller does not set the rank of the items;
nonIssue because of the array??
* not really an issue but I not really know how that mapreduce snippet works ;)



*TODO*
* add device to the hole site
* add a commenting system
* search for schedules with tags(scope :where(tag in tags)???)
* search in general
* add a original date the the schedule to indicate the original creation of the schedule

*meh*
Testing with rspec and cucumber under ruby-1.9.2 and ree-1.8.7,
think i will switch to ree only in the future because thats on my server
