Just messing around with rails 3, mongomapper and BDD

*Features until now*
* creating and editing a schedule with nested items in one form
* calculate the complete distance of the schedule

*Known Issues*
* -when entering an invalid item on the schedule's form you don't receive an error,-
-it just saves the schedule without the invalid item- fixed

*TODO*
* add device to the hole site
* add a commenting system
* add tags to the schedule
* add a original date the the schedule to indicate the original creation of the schedule

*meh*
Testing with rspec and cucumber under ruby-1.9.2 and ree-1.8.7
